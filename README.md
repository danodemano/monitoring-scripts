# monitoring-scripts
A dump of the scripts used to monitor my environment and write to InfluxDB

This is a dump of all the custom bash and python scripts being used to monitor my network/power/enviroment for my home lab.  I used SNMP wherever possible however some things (such as the memory usage of ESXi) I was unable to poll and had to get creative.  Feel free to take this and tweak them to your needs!
